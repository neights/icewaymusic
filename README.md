# Iceway Music User Manual
## Precautions
Currently, Iceway Music is only compatible with the GKD Pixel2 model and can only be used within the iux front - end for the time being. It cannot be displayed on the es front - end.
## I. Installation Steps
1. Obtain the compressed package from the download link and extract it (select "Extract to Current Folder"). The extracted directory should be named "iux". Make sure there is no nested "iux" directory within the "iux" directory. Ensure that the "iux" directory contains program and resource folders.
    - Contents of the "iux" folder:
        - icewaymusic (folder, modified on 3/11/2025 1:23)
        - sections (folder, modified on 3/11/2025 1:23)
        - skins (folder, modified on 3/11/2025 1:23)
2. Shut down the Pixel2, remove the TF card, and then connect the TF card to the computer using a card reader.
3. Copy the extracted "iux" folder to the root directory of the TF card for easier access.
4. After the copy is completed, insert the TF card back into the handheld device and turn it on.
5. After booting up, enter the "File Manager" on the handheld device. Under "/storage" on the left - hand side, find "rgames - external". Enter this folder, and you will see an "iux" folder. Select it, press the X key, choose [Copy], and then click [All]. Thus, the software installation is complete.
    - (1) Open the file management.
    - (2) Select the "games - external" directory in the "storage" directory on the left - hand side.
    - (3) Select the "iux" folder, press the X key, and choose copy.
    - (4) When prompted to overwrite, select "All".
## Music File Placement
Iceway Music supports lossless FLAC, MP3, and WAV formats. You only need to place the downloaded song files into the "music" folder on the Roms disk of the TF card. It is recommended to use QQ Music or NetEase Cloud Music to download songs because these apps will organize the song covers and song information within the song files, facilitating search and display in the software. Meanwhile, Iceway Music also supports LRC - format lyric files. Just ensure that the lyric file name is the same as the song file name and place them together in the "music" folder.
